# Shopping Cart Application

This is a simple shopping cart web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to view a list of products, add them to their shopping cart, manage quantities, apply a discount coupon, and see the total price. The shopping cart data persists across page refreshes using `localStorage`.

## Features

- **Product List Display**: Shows a list of products with names and prices.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to the shopping cart.
- **Modify Cart**: Increase or decrease the quantity of items in the cart, or remove items entirely.
- **Total Calculation**: Automatically calculates and displays the total price of items in the cart.
- **Coupon Discount**: Apply a discount using a specific coupon code (`WEB3BRIDGECOHORTx`).
- **Persistent Cart**: The shopping cart data is saved in `localStorage`, allowing it to persist on page reload.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling, including responsive design for mobile devices.
- **JavaScript**: For handling application logic such as adding items, updating the cart, applying discounts, and persisting data.
